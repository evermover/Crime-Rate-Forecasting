# Overview
The Crime Forecasting Model is a data science project that aims to predict the occurrence of crimes in a given area or region. The model utilizes historical crime data, along with various other relevant factors, to provide forecasts and insights into future criminal activities.

This README file provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, methodology, and instructions for usage. It also outlines the requirements, installation steps, and additional details for anyone interested in utilizing or contributing to the Crime Forecasting Model.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the Crime Forecasting Model is to assist law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and researchers in understanding and predicting crime patterns. By providing accurate forecasts, the model enables proactive measures to be taken to prevent crime, allocate resources effectively, and enhance public safety.

## Methodology
The Crime Forecasting Model employs a machine learning approach to predict crime occurrences. The following steps outline the general methodology:

Data Collection Historical crime data is collected from reliable sources, such as law enforcement agencies or public databases. Additional relevant data, such as demographic information, socioeconomic factors, weather conditions, or urban development data, may also be included.

Data Preprocessing: The collected data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis. This step involves handling missing values, normalizing features, encoding categorical variables, and other necessary data preprocessing techniques.

Feature Engineering: Relevant features are extracted or created from the available data. This step involve aggregating data over specific time periods, generating spatial features, or deriving statistical measures.

Model Training: time series forecasting model is trained using the prepared data. Multiple models may be trained and compared to identify the most accurate and reliable one.

Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error, depending on the specific problem and model type. This step helps in assessing the performance of the models and selecting the best-performing one.

Requirements
To utilize or contribute to the Crime Forecasting Model, the following requirements must be met:

Python 3.x
Data analysis and machine learning libraries (e.g., pandas, fbprophet)
Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
